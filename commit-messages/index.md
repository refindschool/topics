To follow best practices outline in the industry, here is an outline of how commit messages should be formatted.

This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also, often commit messages will be used to **generate a change log** for releases of an application, plugin or code base.

Having commit messages that follow this formatting will prepare your code for distribution, and make formatting consistent.

## Commit message format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

### How to format commits in the GitHub app

## Header

*When you are using the GitHub App, this would be the summary input for a commit message.*

The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various Git tools.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.) *Do not confuse this with styling (css) changes.*
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example:

- `$location` (css) (js) (.gitignore) (readme),
- `$browser` (ie, chrome, safari)
- etc.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: “change” **not “changed” nor “changes”**
- don’t capitalize first letter
- no dot/period (.) at the end

*It’s helpful to think of your commit message always silently starting with “This commit will…”.*

## Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”.

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.

*When you are using the GitHub app, this would be the description input for a commit message.*

## Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

*When you are using the GitHub app, this can be placed as the last line of your description created by a line-break.*

### Keywords for closing issues

The following keywords will close an issue via commit message:

- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
- fixed
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved
