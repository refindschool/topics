Atom is a fairly new code editor created by GitHub. It’s got lots of great features and the community is starting get really big.

**[⬇ Download Atom](https://atom.io/)**

## What Atom does

- Has good GitHub integration
- Supports many languages
- Has a plugin system that allows extending the functionality

---

## What Atom doesn’t do

- Preview your website—that’s what browsers are for
- Let you browse to find a file—typing is faster and more reliable anyways
- Ask you to update links and mess up your whole website

---

## Set up

Atom will work immediately after downloading it—but if you want to get the most out of it, some customization will be needed.

### Settings

To update and add your settings go in the menu to:

```
Atom > Preferences
```

## Snippets

Snippets are little samples of code you can get Atom to automatically insert into your document.

As an example, when creating a new `index.html` file the doctype doesn’t already exist.
You can create a snippet that will insert that code for you.

For me, I type `html5` then hit **tab** and it will insert that code for me.

### Snippets starter

If you want to get a few snippets to start out, you can download my snippets from GitHub.

**[☛ Check out the snippets cheat sheet](/topics/snippets-cheat-sheet/)**

#### Installing

**[⬇ Copy my snippets](https://github.com/acgd-learn-the-web/atom-code/archive/master.zip)**

From Atom, go in the menu to:

```
Atom > Open Your Snippets
```

![](snippets-menu.jpg)

This will open up a new code file. Paste everything you’ve copied from the GitHub into the bottom of this file. And save.

### Collision with Emmet

If you have the Emmet package installed, it will take over the `tab` key, which isn’t ideal.

So, go to your keymap file:

```
Atom > Open Your Keymap
```

![](keymap-menu.jpg)

```coffee
'.pane .editor:not(.mini)':
  'tab': 'snippets:expand'
```

Copy the above couple of lines of code paste it at the bottom of your keymap file.
